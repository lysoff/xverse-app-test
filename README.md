# XVerse App Test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and Typescript

[Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) for state management

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindui.com/) for styling

[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for routing

### To run the app

`npm start`

### Notes

Thanks for the tech assignment

There are some details that are not covered in the current implementation like error handling and skeleton loaders
Design implementation might differ, i'd add another revision for that

Other than that - it should work fine.
Please let me know if there are any questions
